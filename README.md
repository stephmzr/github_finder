# Github Finder

A React.js github research app creating by following the 'React front to back' course of Brad Traversy. 
The application allows you to search for github users and view their personal informations and also their most recent repositories. 
To avoid prop drilling, the app implements state management of the Context API ( useState, useEffect, useContext and useReducer).
